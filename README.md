-  A system to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of a chemical and plastics warehouse using big data engineering tools like Apache Hadoop, Kafka and Spark to store, stream and process data from air quality sensors and gyroscope sensors. With the data from these IoT devices, the system can predict the lifespan of the warehouse`s air filters and the working condition of conveyor belts.
